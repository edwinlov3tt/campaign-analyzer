1 - Make the "Analysis Time Range" include these options date options along with updated instructions based on the selection for how the AI should process them.
- Last 30 days

- Last 90 days
- Last 120 days
- Last 150 days
- Last 180 days
- Last Month
- This Month
- Custom - Start Date / End Date
2 - Make the "Company Information" optional. Once the Lumina Link is added and reports are uploaded all the report to proceed without it. also allow users to just include the campaign objective alone which can be used to help determine campaign goals
3 - The dropdowns in the form generation work great, but the font is greyed out - can you fix this issue? Seems like the greying out of text happens alot can you ensure this doesnt happen? Its the same case on the tables text

4 - Not liking the AI analysis, it was better before. The Performance Analysis by Tactic should be by tactic not "Funnel Analysis, Geographic Performance, or Device & Platform Impact" Each of those should be naturally be output in the by tactic analysis. 
The "Trend Analysis" is "Optimization Opportunities" and "Creative Performance" thats incorrect, it should be Monthly Performance Trends, with Geo or Creative Trend Patterns (or any other important trend patterns)
For the "Strategic Optimization Recommendations" these sections changed revert back to "Geographic Optimization", "Creative Strategy", "Audience Development", "Measurement Improvements" also, device performance isn't that important the analysis
